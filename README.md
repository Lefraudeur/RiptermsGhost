# RiptermsGhost
An example injectable cheat for minecraft using java native interface and jvmti + java asm
#### This branch is an old version that was redefining game classes at runtime

Currently in development.
Uses weird jni export function hooking for better compatibility with clients that doesn't allow the creation of new JNIEnv*.

This cheat is open source, mainly to show you a combination of all the techniques I found to make injectable cheats for minecraft java.

To test it, just build visual studio project ON RELEASE PROFILE, and inject it using any injector.

You have to inject while in game (otherwise some classes are not loaded)


Help would be appreciated, this repo is here to share your knowledge with other people. You can also make suggestions. (open an issue or a pull request to dev branch)

TODO: 
- Good world to screen, to make player and block ESP (so I can get rid of the xray)
- Customizable key binds
- Enabled modules list

You can also test the cheat and tell me about bugs you find, you can try the dev branch, it sometimes contains unstable modules that only works with lunar 1.8.9.

### Future of the project ?
There are some cool jvm tricks I can't implement in the current base, and I also have less time to work on Ripterms.
So future updates will be mainly bug fixes / code restructure for better scalability.
